## frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio

This repository was used to complete Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Website Optimization Project.

In particular, to optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques that were picked up from the Critical Rendering Path course.
