In this project the resume data was stored in four JavaScript Objects according to the schema that was provided. JQuery was then used to append the data to the template
and then append the template to the HTML Elemenets (the object was created in js/resumeBuilder.js). 

The following folder structure describes the layout of the website:
* index.html: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* js/helper.js: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality. More on helper.js further down.
